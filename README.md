# Data-Acquisition-and-ML-Model-Training-System
The project involves setting up Raspberry Pi devices with sensors to collect data, which is then transmitted to a central server using MQTT or other protocols. Data is aggregated, preprocessed, and used to train machine learning models using TensorFlow and PyTorch, which are hosted on cloud platforms.
